A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by specific business domains, such as marketing or sales. This sociotechnical approach shifts the responsibility for analytical data from a central team to the domain teams themselves.

The concept of the data mesh was first introduced by Zhamak Dehghani in 2019. It is founded on four core principles:

*   **Domain Ownership**: Domain teams are responsible for their own data. This decentralization of data ownership moves analytical and operational data away from a central team and to the domain teams.
*   **Data as a Product**: This principle applies product thinking to analytical data. Each domain is responsible for collecting, managing, and serving its data in a way that is easily consumable by others.
*   **Self-Serve Data Platform**: A self-serve data platform is a key concept in a data mesh. It allows all business units to process and store their data products, which avoids duplication of effort.
*   **Federated Computational Governance**: This principle enables data governance at scale. While domain teams own their data products, the data platform and corporate data governance teams track and manage compliance centrally.

### Benefits of a Data Mesh

Data mesh architectures offer several benefits, including:

*   **Increased Agility and Flexibility**: By distributing data ownership, data mesh architectures eliminate operational bottlenecks and reduce the strain on centralized infrastructure. This allows teams to make decisions more quickly.
*   **Improved Scalability and Cost Efficiency**: Data mesh allows each domain to scale independently, which creates a predictable growth pattern. This allows organizations to expand their data capabilities without overwhelming central infrastructure.
*   **Enhanced Data Quality and Trust**: Data mesh makes data creators directly responsible for their output, which improves data quality.
*   **Reduced Technical Debt**: Decentralized data management enhances agility and responsiveness.
*   **Stronger Security and Compliance**: Data mesh architectures enforce data security policies within and between domains. They also provide centralized monitoring and auditing of the data sharing process.

### Data Mesh vs. Data Lake

A data mesh and a data lake differ in their approach to data management. A data lake is a centralized repository that stores raw, unprocessed data from various sources. In contrast, a data mesh emphasizes the distribution of data ownership, where domain teams manage their data products independently. This decentralization empowers teams to define their own data schemas, quality standards, and access mechanisms, promoting greater autonomy and flexibility.
